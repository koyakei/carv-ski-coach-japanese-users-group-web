# inline training with CARV

[slope video](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr3u7VkmGhOlGF0VNnjqFIPABArf7zHAV)

you can do it on slope and [flat pumping](https://youtu.be/sO2aKouklKQ).

# equipment
[Ski road](https://skiroad.it/en/home/)
[Gold 5](https://skiroad.it/en/carbon-gold-5-en/) is the best.
If you have over 90 kg weight, chose [aluminium](https://skiroad.it/en/turn-around-skiroad/).

[two line skate](https://skiroad.it/en/carving5-skiroad/) is for very beginner who can not turn with parallel.

# good point
What is the good point of training on flat road.
## No gravity power 
On slope moving the center of mass to fall line can be helped by gravity, but on flat road, there is not.
In this situation, if you brake the speed in turn end wih moving the center of mass against fall line, you can slow down immediately.

## No chair lift waiting
6 hours ski, 1 hour on slope.
1 hour pumping on flat road, 1 hour parallel ski.

## precise balance score
On bumpy condition, balance score has a lot of noise. But on flat road bump depth less than 5mm, there is not.
If your pressure smoothness score is over 95, you can regard as no noise.

# step of training

## target
### make sure the timing of turin switching
For improve outside ski pressure score, timing is the base of effort.

### same distance between gripping points to road.
during pumping this distance is easier to change than slope.

## training method

### outside ski pressure monitor mode

outside ski pressure monitor mode is the first.
You can lift your leg. Until you can score over 80 in contentious 10 turns.
After this, put your feet on the road, then try to maintain it.
If you have 1-degree descent, that becomes very easy. From this fact, your outside ski pressure on the slope is very helped by gravity and very loose.
Completely flat road, you can make average over 80.
That does not make big hart rate, usually  around 120 - 130.
If you tiered by another practice please try it.

### Improve balance score
That is not necessary, because there is no monitor mode,
If you can enjoy this please try.

### edge similarity.
After that try edge similarity. Maintaining over 90 is a good target.
For improving edge similarity, the edge angle needs over 25.

After all. you can enjoy ski IQ monitor mode.
1 turn max is over 155. On flat road average can over 140.

# theory

## using boots flex
you can fully bend boots. Forward length is shorter than ski, but press toe wheel completely, boots can bend to max rebound.
To do it, keep center of mass on center wheel, then press toe with pitching moment.

## move center of mass to foll line
In turn max to end, move center of mass to fall line with heel pressure, not roll recovery.

## do not use front side muscle and tendon of knee
If you use this muscle, easy to injure and tiered.

## keep heel pressure after turn switch
In flat inline to keep outside pressure, easy to tend lift your one ski from road longer than snow.
But that is makes low outside ski pressure, because of gravity does not help you on flat road.
To avoid this, maintain heep pressure and grip only 2nd wheel from tail, then make smaller radius turn in turn end.
Or in turn max, thrust your center of mass to fall line with heel pressure.

## wide stance
Carv does not have preciseness to detect very short (0.5 second per one) turn.
And Carv preciseness of detect turn switching is 0.1 second.
Rider can't know what timing is Carv define turn switching more than 0.1 second preciseness, so improve score rider must seek workaround.
So to avoid error then keep good edge similarity and outside ski pressure both, maintain both ski touched on road and reduce pressure both at once.
During reduce pressure both at once, change yaw rotation rate significantly enough to tell turn switching to Carv. 
To do this improve roll angular momentum by wide stance for improve and release outside ski pressure just after turn switched, then contact next outside ski after 60ms.

In addition, wide stance makes big early edging score.

Why wider stance makes grater roll angular momentum.
If there is no horizontal distance between supporting basis and center of mass cause there is no angular momentum.

## bending turn
That is one way of training. Usually you should skate with stretching turn, but to learn move weight to fall line side, bending turn is very helpful.
